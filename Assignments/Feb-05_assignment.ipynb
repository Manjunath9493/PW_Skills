    "Inheritance is a mechanism in which one class acquires the property of another class. For example, a child inherits the traits of his/her parents.With inheritance, we can reuse the fields and methods of the existing class. Hence, inheritance facilitates Reusability \n",
    "\n",
    "Types of Inheritance:\n",
    "1. Single inheritance: In this type of inheritance, a subclass inherits the attributes and behaviors from a single base class. For example, in a scenario where a \"Bird\" class is the base class and a \"Parrot\" class is the derived class, the \"Parrot\" class would inherit the attributes and behaviors of the \"Bird\" class.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Multiple inheritance: In this type of inheritance, a subclass inherits the attributes and behaviors from multiple base classes. For example, in a scenario where a \"Mammal\" class and a \"Flying\" class are base classes and a \"Bat\" class is the derived class, the \"Bat\" class would inherit the attributes and behaviors of both the \"Mammal\" and \"Flying\" classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Multi-level inheritance: In this type of inheritance, a subclass inherits from a derived class, which in turn inherits from a base class. For example, in a scenario where a \"Animal\" class is the base class, a \"Bird\" class is a derived class, and a \"Parrot\" class is another derived class, the \"Parrot\" class would inherit the attributes and behaviors of both the \"Bird\" class and the \"Animal\" class.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Hierarchical inheritance: In this type of inheritance, multiple derived classes inherit from a single base class. For example, in a scenario where a \"Animal\" class is the base class and \"Cat\", \"Dog\", and \"Horse\" classes are derived classes, all the derived classes would inherit the attributes and behaviors of the \"Animal\" class.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Hybrid inheritance: In this type of inheritance, a combination of two or more types of inheritance is used in a single program. For example, a scenario where a \"Vehicle\" class is the base class, a \"FourWheeler\" class and a \"TwoWheeler\" class are derived classes, and a \"Car\" class and a \"Bike\" class are further derived classes, the \"Car\" class would inherit the attributes and behaviors of both the \"FourWheeler\" and \"Vehicle\" classes, and the \"Bike\" class would inherit the attributes and behaviors of both the \"TwoWheeler\" and \"Vehicle\" classes.\n"
